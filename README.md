# Zac Austin

## ðŸ˜„ About
Iâ€™m currently the Head of Audio and Systems at [45 Productions](https://45productions.com.au/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=zacaustin), where I primarily work on live audio for school musical theatre in Sydney, Australia.

At [45 Productions](https://45productions.com.au/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=zacaustin), we develop a wide range of internal software, tools, interfaces, applications, and embedded devices. My primary language is Node.js (JavaScript), but I also work with C++, AVR C, Swift, and more.

## ðŸ¤” What's in this repository?
This repository contains a generator I created to automate repetitive setup processes for my software development projects.

Right now, it only generates package.json files for Node.js projects, but I plan to expand it with more features over time. Eventually, it will use EJS templates to dynamically generate file contents, keeping everything modular and reducing boilerplate.

If youâ€™re interested, feel free to try it out!

I plan to constantly expand this repository to include various tools, scripts, and utilities that I use in my daily work. As a byproduct of making these resources easily accessible for myself, you also get a sneak peek at how my brain works!

Enjoy!
